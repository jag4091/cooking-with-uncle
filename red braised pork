Heat oil in pan, add scallions and ginger and slowly saute until they are golden brown and fragrant. 

Add star anise, cinnamon and bay leaf, saute 1 minute. Add pork and quickly sear outside.

Add both soy sauces and stir quickly, then add rice wine and deglaze pan. Add enough water to cover the meat, and the rock sugar, cover pan, lower heat and simmer for 30 minutes. 

Add vinegar and continue simmering for around 15 more minutes or until liquid is reduced to around 30 per cent of original volume.

Turn up heat to quickly reduce sauce until it reaches a syrupy consistency and thickly coats the meat. Serve immediately with hot rice.
